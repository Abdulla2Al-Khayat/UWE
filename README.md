# Worksheet 2 part 1
Connect to a remote server and test the Morse code converter
Implement the encode() and decode() functions using a Binary tree approach in morse.py and create a function to print the tree instance to the console
Write unit tests for the Binary tree implementation and encode/decode functions using the unittest module
Update the README.md file to provide clear instructions for running the code and examples of each part working
Push all changes to a new Git repository and submit the repository URL on Blackboard.

# Worksheet 2 part 2
The task is about Morse code and binary heaps.
There are two tasks in this worksheet.
Task 1 involves implementing a function to decode Morse code using a binary heap and writing unit tests to validate the implementation.
Task 2 involves writing Python functions to encode and decode Morse code used in Ham Radio conversations.

# Worksheet 3
The task is to create a WebSocket server and client using Node.js and the ws library.
The server should listen on a specified port and wait for incoming connections.
When a client connects, the server should log a message and send a welcome message to the client.
The client should connect to the server and send a message to the server.
When the server receives the message from the client, it should log the message and send a response message back to the client.
