# Worksheet 2 part 2
1. The task is about Morse code and binary heaps.
2. There are two tasks in this worksheet.
3. Task 1 involves implementing a function to decode Morse code using a binary heap and writing unit tests to validate the implementation.
4. Task 2 involves writing Python functions to encode and decode Morse code used in Ham Radio conversations.
